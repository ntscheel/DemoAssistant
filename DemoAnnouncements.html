			<h2>New Feature: Demo Webpage</h2>
			<em>Published 2017-01-17 11:46:53 by Nick Scheel</em><br>
			<p><p>Hello!</p><br />
			<p>This is a demo webpage, modeled after the Ticket Assist project for the University of St. Thomas Tech Desk. Please note that this demo is not connected to a MySQL database, so some functionality is lost. However, dummy values have been placed in response to this. For example, the actual accounements are confidential, so this is a placeholder.</p><br />
			<p>If you run into any issues with this demo page, please let me know by emailing me at ntscheel@gmail.com</p><br />
			<p>If you run into any problems with this new feature, please let us know at our <a href="#">Feedback Page</a>.</p></p>

			<h2>New Feature: Generic Responses</h2>
			<em>Published 2017-01-17 11:46:53 by Nick Scheel</em><br>
			<p><p>Hello TD!</p><br />
			<p>We have added a new feature that allows you to easily create and access email templates to copy/paste into tech notes. It can be found on the home page in the center section.</p><br />
			<p>To add a new template, simply click the provided link which will send you to the Generic Response Edit page. From here, there are two tabs. One will allow you to create a new response, and the other will allow you to delete them.</p><br />
			<p>If you run into any problems with this new feature, please let us know at our <a href="#">Feedback Page</a>.</p></p>

			<h2>Introducing Notifications!</h2>
			<em>Published 2016-12-07 14:43:22 by Nick Scheel</em><br>
			<p><p>Hello Beta testers!</p><br />
			<p>We have begun the implementation of notifications, which can be seen in the "Notifications" tab here in the center of the home page. When you receive a new notification, you will see a number indicating how many are unseen. These unseen notifications will also have a bubble "New" next to them. To mark them as seen, simply click the "Dismiss" link to the right of each notification.</p><br />
			<p>By default, only the 5 most recent notifications will be shown. To see more, click the link labeled "Show More Notifications" at the bottom.</p><br />
			<p>As always, if you run into any problems with this feature, let us know by submitting feedback <a href="#" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>!</p></p>
